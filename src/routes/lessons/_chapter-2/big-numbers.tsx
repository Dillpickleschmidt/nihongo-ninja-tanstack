            Understanding big numbers in Japanese is essential for navigating
            everyday situations, such as reading prices, dealing with currency,
            or discussing quantities. It's especially important because Japanese
            currency primarily deals with large values. In this lesson, we'll
            explore big numbers in Japanese and practice reading them as both
            digits and kanji.

            By practicing these numbers, you will become more comfortable with
            reading and understanding prices. In the next lesson, we'll dive
            deep into Japanese currency and shopping.
