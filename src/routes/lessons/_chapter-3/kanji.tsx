          Kanji are characters that originated in China and were brought to
          Japan over 1,500 years ago. Each Kanji is a logogram, meaning it
          represents a standalone meaning, as opposed to a sound like English
          characters.

            <li>
              <strong>Elementary school: </strong>1,026 kanji (

          <span class="font-extrabold">Student:</span> How were Kanji created?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Kanji can be divided into
          four types based on their formation:
        </p>
        <ol class="mt-3 ml-9 list-decimal space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Pictograms:</strong> Êú® (tree), Êó• (sun), Â±± (mountain)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple ideograms:</strong> ‰∏ä (up), ‰∏ã (down), ‰∏≠ (middle)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compound ideograms:</strong> Êûó (forest) = two Êú® (tree)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phonetic-ideographic:</strong> one element for meaning, one
            hinting at sound
          </li>
        </ol>

        {/* Reading */}
        <p>
          <span class="font-extrabold">Student:</span> How do I <em>read</em>{" "}
          them?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-extrabold">Sensei:</span> Well, since you asked,
          there are <em>technically</em> two ways to read kanji, but there's
          also a third option that's much easier to remember:
        </p>
        <ol class="mt-3 ml-9 list-decimal space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>On-yomi (Èü≥Ë™≠„Åø):</strong> Chinese-derived readings
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kun-yomi (Ë®ìË™≠„Åø):</strong> Native Japanese readings
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="mt-3">
          For example, the kanji <span class="font-japanese">Â±±</span>{" "}
          (mountain) can be read as:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-3 ml-9 list-disc space-y-2">
          <li>
            On-yomi: <span class="font-japanese text-xl">„Çµ„É≥</span> (san),{" "}
            <span class="font-japanese text-xl">„Çª„É≥</span> (sen)
          </li>
          <li>
            Kun-yomi: <span class="font-japanese text-xl">„ÇÑ„Åæ</span> (yama)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground mt-3 text-base italic">
          *There are also <strong>name</strong> readings which are unique
          readings for peoples' names.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          In many cases, a single kanji will have <strong>multiple</strong>{" "}
          on-yomi and kun-yomi readings.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3 text-base italic">
          You will see these whenever you look up a kanji in a dictionary.

        <h3 class="text-center text-3xl font-bold italic">No!</h3>
        <p class="mt-4">
          In fact, we recommend you{" "}

            forget about the on-yomi/kun-yomi readings
          </span>

          English <strong>meanings</strong> of the kanji you come across,
          exactly as you've been doing on <strong>jpdb</strong>.
        </p>
        <div class="mt-4">
          <strong>Think about it like this: </strong>In English, there are at
          least a dozen (maybe more) ways to pronounce the letter{" "}
          <span class="font-black">a</span>:
          <ul class="mt-3 ml-9 list-disc space-y-2">
            <li>A = /√¶/ - Apple, Fantastic, Back, Track, Exactly</li>
            <li>A = /e/ - Any, Many, Said, Says, Thames</li>
            <li>A = /…í/ - What, Watch, Want, Was, Wash, Yacht</li>
            <li>A = /e…™/ - Able, Age, Page, Paper, Day, Date, Stay</li>
            <li>A = /e…ô/ - Air, Share, Care, Spare, Stare, Rare</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4 text-center italic">The list goes on...</p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            But do you memorize each pronunciation of{" "}
            <span class="font-black">a</span> in isolation?{" "}
            <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> You learn the <em>vocabulary</em>{" "}
            and pick up the different pronunciations of{" "}
            <span class="font-black">a</span> as you go along. We believe the
            same goes for kanji readings. Focus on vocabulary and the meanings
            of the kanji you're learning, and you'll naturally pick up the
            readings over time.
