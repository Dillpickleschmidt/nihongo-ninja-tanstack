● Deck and Folder Edit Functionality - Complete Implementation Overview

Architecture Overview

A comprehensive edit system that supports both authenticated users (Supabase) and anonymous users (session storage) with optimistic updates.

Core Components Built

1. Business Logic Layer

- deck-edit-operations.ts - Core business logic for all edit operations
- edit-transaction.ts - Transaction coordinator for atomic operations
- Unit tests for both files ensuring reliability

2. Database Layer

- PostgreSQL stored procedure - execute_edit_transaction for atomic database operations
- executeEditTransactionServerFn - Server function wrapper for database transactions
- Session storage extensions - Atomic updates for anonymous users

3. UI Components

- EditModal.tsx - Main edit dialog with form validation
- LocationSelector.tsx - Tree-based folder picker with exclusion logic
- LocationBreadcrumb.tsx - Visual path indicator
- DeleteConfirmation.tsx - Deletion strategy selection
- TreeView component - Reusable tree UI with selection and expansion

4. Hooks and State Management

- useEditValidation.ts - Form validation logic
- useFolderTree.ts - Tree data transformation with exclusion rules
- Extended useVocabPageState.ts - Integrated edit functions with optimistic updates

5. Supporting Files

- folderUtils.ts - Path and folder ID utilities
- Edit triggers - Added to UserDeckCard and FolderCard

User Flow Walkthrough

Deck Edit Flow:

1. User clicks edit on a deck card → handleEditDeck opens EditModal
2. Modal renders with current deck name and location pre-filled
3. User modifies name and/or selects new folder location via tree picker
4. User clicks Save → handleSave creates EditTransaction
5. Optimistic update → UI immediately reflects changes
6. Background sync → Database/session storage updated
7. Auto-refetch → Real IDs replace temporary ones (no loading spinner)
8. Modal closes → User sees updated deck in new location

Folder Edit Flow:

1. User clicks edit on a folder card → handleEditFolder opens EditModal
2. Modal renders with folder exclusion logic (can't move into self/descendants)
3. User modifies name and/or parent folder
4. Same optimistic update pattern as deck editing
5. Folder tree updates to reflect new hierarchy

Delete Flow:

1. User clicks Delete → DeleteConfirmation component appears
2. For folders with contents → User chooses strategy:
   - "Move contents up" - Children move to parent folder
   - "Delete everything" - Recursive deletion

3. Confirmation → EditTransaction executes deletion
4. UI updates → Items removed from interface

Technical Deep Dive

Edit Transaction System:

const transaction = new EditTransaction()
transaction.add({
type: "update-deck",
deckId: 123,
updates: { name: "New Name", folderId: 456 }
})
await executeEdit(transaction)

Optimistic Updates Pattern:

1. Immediate UI update - User sees changes instantly
2. Background persistence - Database/storage sync
3. Auto-refetch - Real data replaces optimistic data
4. Error rollback - Reverts on failure

Folder Exclusion Logic:

// Prevents moving folders into themselves or descendants
if (props.item && !("deck_id" in props.item)) {
// Exclude self and all descendants from picker
}

Dual Storage Strategy:

- Authenticated users → Supabase with PostgreSQL stored procedures
- Anonymous users → Session storage with atomic writes
- Same UI experience for both user types

Key Features Implemented

Smart Folder Picker:

- Tree view with expand/collapse
- Prevents invalid moves (folder into itself)
- Different rules for deck vs folder editing
- Visual breadcrumbs showing current vs selected path

Form Validation:

- Real-time name validation
- Duplicate name checking within folder
- Length limits and required fields
- Immediate visual feedback

Robust Error Handling:

- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- User-friendly error messages
- Consistent behavior across user types

Performance Optimizations:

- Removed loading spinners (optimistic updates eliminate need)
- Efficient tree rendering with memoization
- Background refetching without UI disruption

Recent Improvements

Bug Fixes:

- Folder picker exclusion bug - Fixed incorrect exclusion of valid folders when editing decks
- Production code cleanup - Removed debug code and optimized hooks

UX Enhancements:

- Eliminated loading flashes - Removed all loading indicators in favor of optimistic updates
- Smooth transitions - Auto-refetch happens silently in background
- Immediate feedback - Users never wait for operations to complete

Architecture Benefits

1. Universal Design - Works identically for authenticated and anonymous users
2. Atomic Operations - All edits are transactional and safe
3. Optimistic UX - Instant feedback with background sync
4. Type Safety - Full TypeScript coverage with proper type discrimination
5. Testable - Core logic separated from UI with comprehensive tests
6. Scalable - Transaction system can easily support new operation types

The system provides a production-ready editing experience that feels instant to users while maintaining data consistency and reliability behind the scenes.
